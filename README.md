First, you need to run the node server js in the terminal. After that, open http://localhost:5002 in browser.
It will display the home page, which contains a navigation bar with Home, About, and Contact options.
When you click on About or Contact in the navigation bar, you will be redirected to the respective pages. You can also directly access these pages using the links:
http://localhost:5002/about
http://localhost:5002/contact
If you enter an invalid URL or a non-existing page, such as http://localhost:5002/about123, the application will display the 404 page.
